                    <p>Have you ever felt that you're spending way too much time doing anything else than something productive? Perhaps you're spending your time watching Netflix, scrolling through the same posts on Reddit, or just straight up playing video games? Yeah, me too.</p>

                    <p>Do you ever look back to the last 6 months of your life and realize you've done absolutely nothing to improve yourself?

                    <p>I do.</p>

                    <p>I also have this ridiculous habit of coming up with grand schemes to better myself, only to notice that I'm still playing video games a week later. I love entertainment, but it's not doing any good for my career. </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Entertainment Kills Productivity</h2>

                    <p>Here's a scenario: </p><p>You've always wanted to play the guitar, but never had one. Someone gives you one as a gift. You play for a little while, realize that you're not learning as fast as you hoped you would. Frustration. New episode of Game of Thrones is on. What do you do?</p>

                    <p>Alright. So you decide to watch Game of Thrones, not a big deal. </p>

                    <p>It's not a big deal. The real problem is when you actually start wasting your whole day choosing entertainment over productivity. Do I choose short-term happiness over a long-term one? Yes!</p>

                    <p>If we are entertained so easily, why would we ever want to be productive? Learning a trade is so awfully far-sighted. Pfft.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Can Entertainment Be Good For You?</h2>

                    <p>Aside from watching a ton of series, I believe my greatest entertainment and downfall has been competitive gaming. You usually get something real out of it, even though it is in a form of pixels. </p>
                    <p>The competitive game you're playing usually has a ranking system, which pretty much defines your skill. The better you are, the higher ranked you are going to be. Then you spend your time climbing the ranks, improving after every victory. </p>
                    <p>You learn the game, you build your muscle memory and game sense. If the game has different maps that impact gameplay, you will spend time learning those.
                    <p>Some people even acquire the skills required to work efficiently as a team. That's the greatest thing you can learn from competitive games.</p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Competitive gaming kicks ass.</span>
                    <p>On top of that, the e-sports industry is growing up rapidly. If you get really good at a video game, you could make a ton of money. More than a ton. The thought of improving yourself to the point where you'd be able to make money by just playing video games. Wow.</p>
                    <p>But it's not just playing video games. Professional players practise from dusk till dawn. They study their opponents, their strategies and might even come up with some counter-strategies. Time consuming, but rewarding. </p>
                    <p>Like every other trade.</p>
                    <p>The problem for me has been that video games captivate, while coding does not. This makes it really hard for me to focus on my career. That should change. </p>
                    <p>I should make developing software as my main entertainment. So should you.</p>
